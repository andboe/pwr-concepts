## Default roles <a name="default-roles"></a> <.>

We provide six default roles with pre-defined access rights.
You can customize the default roles and/or {% link_new add your own roles | features/account/configure-user-roles.md %}. <.>

The tables in this article list apps and features for relevant default roles.
The green checkmark icon <i class="icon-check" style="color:#1cb396"></i> indicates full (read and write) access. <.>
Because your WFM plan determines the available features, you may not have access to every item listed.
